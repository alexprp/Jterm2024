Investigating the mystery clump: Is it alive?

Test 1: Can the clump grow when plated on fresh media?
Hypothesis: If the clump is a fungus contamination, it should grow on nutrient agar plates.
Approach: Plate 200 μl on high salt + high nutrient agar (Hh-YPC), high salt + low nutrient (Hh-CA) agar, low salt + high nutrient agar (LB). Incubate at 37°C for three days.
Positive control for growth high salt + high nutrient: Haloarcula hispanica wild-type
Positive control for growth on low salt + high nutrient: E. coli
Initial observations: the HhCA plates had particulates embedded in the agar despite being stored in the cold 		room (4°C) since 2016.

Test 2: Does bleach affect the clumps?
Hypothesis: If the clump is a cell, bleach should lyse or kill the cell and it will no longer be detected by phase microscopy.
Approach: Add bleach to an aliquot of 4 ml of Hh-CA liquid media, both unfiltered and filtered batches. Mix bleach with media by swirling/vortexing. Prepare agarose pads on glass slides, add 3 - 7 μl media, and cover with glass coverslip. Use 100X objective with oil to look for clumps by phase microscopy.
Positive control for clumps: untreated Hh-CA.
Control for addition of aqueous bleach: Hh-CA with water added instead of bleach.
Observations: Clumps were easily found in the untreated Hh-CA. No clumps were detected in the both bleach treated media. A single clump was found in the water diluted media.
